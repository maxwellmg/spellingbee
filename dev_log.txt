# spellingbee
replicating NYTs spelling bee game for coding practice

Game will be capable of being run in Terminal

Dev log to track tasks needing to be completed and progress.

Tasks to accomplish
1. Create a list of eligible panagrams
  a. Find a free online dictionary (COMPLETE)
  b. Discern a discreet list of words that contain exactly 7 unique letters
    - create a program that makes histogram for each word (COMPLETE)
    - run program on dictionary to create list of just panagrams, save as new file (COMPLETE)
    - In completing this, we see a new problem: most of these words are rubbish. Need to find a method to disclude ridiculous words
        -Solution #1: Cross-reference words with Merriam Webster by checking response codes. 200s make the final list, 404s do not. Should reduce panagram list by 1/3. (COMPLETE)
        -Secondary potential solution: find a large text or several large texts. Create find threshhold of frequency for words that would include/disclude word from final list

2. For each panagram, find a list of words that can only be made from its letters (COMPLETE)
    -Sub-mission: eliminate non merriam webster words from this list (COMPLETE)

3. Make callable functions for main run script to use (COMPLETE)

4. Make playable run (COMPLETE)

5. Create a Terminal Help Menu (IN PROGRESS)
    -Potential Menu items
        -(R): Print rules of the game
        -(S): See current score
        -(Q): Quit out of game, lose progress
        -(H): Exit help menu
        -(W): See words successfully submitted thus far
        -Make a toggle for print statements?

6. Create Print Statements for a Terminal Run-through (COMPLETE)
    -Potential print statements:
        "Randomly selecting a Word"
        "Randomly picking a letter in that Word"
        "Curating custom word list"
        Perhaps a randomly selected loading phrase ["crossing ts, dotting is", "filtering out curse words", etc]
